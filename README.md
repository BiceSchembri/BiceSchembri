### ‚ÑπÔ∏è About me

I am a **junior backend developer** interested in web applications and software solutions. After a training at [BeCode](https://becode.org/) in Ghent, BE, I did a 3-month internship working with C# .NET (ASP.NET Core MVC, REST APIs, Azure DevOps). 

I wanted to learn how things work behind the scenes - how we go from safely storing data, to building connections, to making information accessible. I have changed a few countries, jobs, and languages - and curiosity has been serving me well!

My current goal is to keep diving deep into backend languages and frameworks. I wish to contribute to building solutions for a fairer world, bit by bit.
