### ‚ÑπÔ∏è About me

I am a **junior backend developer** trained at [BeCode](https://becode.org/) in Ghent, BE. I like making things work behind the scenes - how we go from safely storing data, to building connections, to making information accessible.

My name is Italian, but I have heard it pronounced in many different ways by now. Over the last ten years I have lived in several different countries, which meant **learning new things** (and new words!) almost every day. And curiosity stuck well with me.

My current goal is to keep diving deep into backend languages and frameworks, and move on to **software development**. I wish to contribute to building solutions for a fairer world, bit by bit.
