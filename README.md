### About me :clipboard:

I am a trainee at BeCode Ghent, on my way to complete an intensive web developer course with a focus on backend languages. I like to see the logic of how things work behind the scenes - how we go from storing data, to building connections, to sharing information.

My name is Italian, but I have heard it pronounced in many different ways by now. Over the last ten years I have lived in several different countries, which meant learning new things (and new words!) almost every day. It meant changing jobs, too - from administrative assistant, to library help, to translator.

My current goal is to keep diving deep into backend languages and frameworks, and move on to software development.
